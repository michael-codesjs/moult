# Username Management and Cognito Integration

This is the main rule for the integration of the Username Management service with the Cognito service to assign generated usernames to Cognito users.

## Overview

The goal is to implement a seamless integration between the Username Management service and the Cognito service to ensure that generated usernames are properly assigned to Cognito users.

## Key Components

1. **Username Generation**: Handled by the Username Management service
2. **Event Publishing**: Username generated events are published to EventBridge
3. **Event Consumption**: Cognito service consumes username generated events
4. **Username Assignment**: Cognito service updates user attributes with the generated username

## Implementation Steps

1. Create a new Lambda function in the Cognito service to handle username generated events
2. Implement the logic to update Cognito user attributes with the generated username
3. Configure EventBridge rules to route username generated events to the new Lambda function
4. Update the serverless configuration to deploy the new Lambda function
5. Add appropriate error handling, logging, and monitoring

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for the new Lambda function
2. Integration tests for the event flow
3. End-to-end tests for the complete user creation and username assignment flow
